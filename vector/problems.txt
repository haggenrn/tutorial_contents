Issues that have been encountered during vector tutorial: module 'geopandas' has no attribute 'points_from_xy' in geopandas_intro.ipynb, and No module named 'no module named 'folium' in geopandas_advanced.ipyn. 
These issues arose even when vector environment configuration was installed from github forked repo.
UTM will not install in OSMnx_hotosm.ipynb...why? 
even more issues encountered in geoviews tutorial. 
Run all notebooks and check outputs. Many errors have occured.
